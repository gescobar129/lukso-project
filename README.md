Evolve Wallet
Is a Lukso blockchain cryptocurrency wallet with a gamified NFT experience for mobile devices. The wallet allows the user to hold, send, and view LSP7 / LSP8 Tokens (the respective equivalents for ERC20 and ERC721 NFT standards on the Lukso Blockchain). Every wallet will have a virtual pet NFT that exists within the app and can grow based on the interactions the user does with the chain. The more the user transacts with their wallet, the more exp their monster gains in turn unlocking new features. In the beginning the monster will start off as an egg, and over time it will hatch and grow!
